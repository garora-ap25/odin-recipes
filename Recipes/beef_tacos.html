       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Dried chile peppers: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.
                    </li>
               <li>Beef: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.
                    </li>
               <li>Seasonings: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
                    </li>
               <li>Olive oil: Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.
